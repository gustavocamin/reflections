When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	-When i am working in a project with other people, in a colaborative way.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 	-Because is good to be able to modify and be sure about the funcionalities and new stuff you made before going public with it.
