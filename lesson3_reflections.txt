When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	-When i am working in a project with other people, in a colaborative way.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 	-Because you may be working in the same code as someone else, or in a file that is affected, and if the update was automatic it would imply in errors

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-Forks are the versions of someones repository you copy to your GitHub. Clones are local versions of someones repository you make. Branches are versions of a repository you created.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	-this way you know what you did and is not on the cloud, available to everyone. You can have an idea of what parts of your work everyone has and what you are the only one to get access to it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	-Without git or github i would have to keep a lot of versions of the code distributed, and every time someone changed something we would have to see if anyone depends on it and then change on everyones version. It would be very harder.
